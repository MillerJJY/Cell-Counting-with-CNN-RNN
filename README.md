# Cell-Counting-with-CNN-RNN
A model that uses CNN for feature extraction and RNN to track cells between frames for cell counting. 

# Running The Code
1. Open the ipynb file in Google Colab with GPU runtime type.
2. In cell 1, specify the path of the folder containing the raw data and labels. The assumption is that the folder will be located in your Google Drive, which is why the code mounts your Drive; if this is not the case, comment that section out if desired.  
3. Run all the code.
